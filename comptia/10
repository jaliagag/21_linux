# FINAL NOTES

## Network commands

1. ip: ip arg action - ip addr show
  - ip link: configuring, adding and deleting NICs
  - ip address: display addr, bind new and delete old addresses. `ip address show dev enp0s8`
  - ip route: display the routing table `ip route show`
2. nmap: used for network discovery, security auditing, and administration. 
  - `-sn`: check which hosts are up. `nmap -sn 10.0.0.0/24` <-- checks all hosts in the subnet
3. ping: check if a host is alive
  - `-n` prevents reverse DNS lookup
  - `-c` determines amount of packages to send
4. iPerf: analyze and measure network performance between 2 hosts. iPerf needs to be initiated on both nodes
  - `-s`: iperf starts listening
  - `-c <IP>`: on the second machine run `iperf -c <IP>`- we'll get the _bandwidth_.
5. traceroute: see what route packets are taking - shows sequence of gateways through which the packets travel to reach their destination.
6. tcdump: packet sniffing tool. It listens to the network traffic and prints packet information based on the criteria you define.
7. netstat: examine network connections, routing tables, and various network settings and statistics. no options displays a list of _open_ sockets (`-a`).
  - `-i` to list the network interfaces on your system (_same as ip link_)
  - `-r` display the routing table. * means no gateway defined
  - `-l` shows only listening sockets
8. ss: 
  - `-t` `-a` to list all TCP sockets (listening and non-listening sockets)
9. ssh: to connect securely with remote hosts over the internet. OpenSSH msut be installed
10. scp and sftp
11. ifconfig: check the IP address
12. dig: interrogating DNS name servers. it performs DNS lookups and displays the answers that are returned from the name servers.
13. nslookup: query domain name servers and resolving IP
14. nc: allows 2 computers to connect and share resources - wide range of functionalities. it can also be used to send and receive files <https://linuxhandbook.com/nc-command/>
  - `-l <PORT>` on the listening machine. + `-u` UDP connection
  - `<IP> <PORT>` establishes a connection
  - `-v -n 127.0.0.1 1-100` checks the first 100 ports
15. iptables: configure specific rules that will be enforced by the kernel's `netfilter` network. It acts as a packet filter and firewall that examines and directs traffic based on port, protocol and other criteria
16. route: used to view and make changes to the kernel routing table
17. arp: manipulates or displays de kernel's IPv4 network neighbour cache. it can add entries to the table, delte one, or display the current content.

## Config files

## firewalld iptables

### firewalld

firewalld - `sudo firewall-cmd --state` firewalld takes your network interfaces and puts them in _zones_. zones are how we filter. if we have 2 interfaces in the same zone, there's no filter

- `firewall-cmd --get-zones` - written to disk; most commands are written to ram
- `firewall-cmd --get-default-zone`
- `firewall-cmd --get-active-zones`
- `firewall-cmd --new-zone=testlab` --> ram
- `firewall-cmd --permanent --new-zone=testlab` --> ram
- `firewall-cmd --reload`

customize _rules_ - allow or block a service to pass through your firewall. 

- `firwall-cmd --get-services`

rules/services are stored in **/usr/lib/firewalld/services/**

- `firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http`
- `firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=ftp`
- `firewall-cmd --list-services`
- `firewall-cmd --permanent --list-services`
- `firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=8080/tcp` - add non-standard port to the list
- `firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=50000-60000/tcp` - add range 
- `firewall-cmd --permanent --list-ports`

### iptables

iptables and firewalld are front ends for netfilter. 

- `iptables --list` rules that are in place
- `iptables --list-rules` rules that are in place
