MAC address: media access control - it's a permanent physical and unique address assigned to NIC to the device manufacturer. the mac address is used within the network to identify devices and transfer data between devices. Each packet transmitted has a source mac and a destination mac.

Why change the mac? increase anonymity. impersonate other devices. bypass filters.

```console
# disable the interface
ifconfig <nic mac address> down
ifconfig eth0 down
# modify ether, mac address
ifconfig <nic> hw ether <new mac address>
ifconfig eth0 ether 00:11:22:33:44:55
# bring back the nic
ifconfig eth0 up
```

MAC address changer python program

```py
#!/usr/bin/env python

import subprocess
subprocess.call("ifconfig", shell=True)
# thus far this is just running ifconfig and returning the output of the command
# this is unnecessary for the program
subprocess.call("ifconfig wlan0 down", shell=True)
subprocess.call("ifconfig wlan0 hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55", shell=True)
subprocess.call("ifconfig wlan0 up", shell=True)
```
