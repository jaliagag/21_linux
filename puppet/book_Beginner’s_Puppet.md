# Puppet 5 Beginnerâ€™s Guide Go from newbie to pro with Puppet 5

Puppet is two things: a language for expressing the desired state (how your nodes should be configured), and an engine that interprets code written in the Puppet language and applies it to the nodes to bring about the desired state.

```puppet
package { 'curl':
    ensure => instaled,
}
```

1. check the list of installed software on the node to see if curl is installed
2. if it is, do nothing
3. if not, install it

puppet programs are called manifests: a set of declarations about what things should exist and how should be configured.

- resources: types of things that can exist, such as users, files or packages
- attributes: appropriate properties for the type fo resource (home dir for a user, owner and permissions for a file)

puppet architectures:

- agent/master: a special node dedicated to running puppet, which all other nodes contact to get their configuration
- stand-alone puppet or masterless: no need for a special master node. puppet runs on each individual node and odes not need to contract a central location to get its configuration. use git, sftp or rsync

## chapter 2

```pp
file { '/tmp/hello.txt':
    ensure => file,
    content => "hello, world\n",
}
```

resource declartion pattern

```txt
RESOURCE_TYPE { TITLE:
    ATTRIBUTE => VALUE,
    ...
}
```

- TITLE: the name that Puppet uses to identify the resource internally. with file resources, it's usual for this to be the full path of the file

the ATTRIBUTES available depend on the type of the resource. for file:

- content: sets the _entire_ content of a file to a string value you provide
- owner
- group
- mode

all resources support the **ensure** attribute. the _values_ for `ensure` vary depending on the resource type. we use _file_ to indicate a regular file, as opposed to a directory or symlink

if you make a chanage to a file without also changeing the puppet manifest to match, puppet will overwrite the file the next ime it runs, and your changes will be lost

dry-run: `--noop` flag to `puppet apply` will show you what puppet would have done, without actually changing anything. `--show_diff` to view the changes to be done.

puppet decides whether or not a file resource needs updating, based on its MD5 hash sum.

how are manifests applied?

1. puppet reads the manifest and the list of resources it contains and compiles these into a **catalog** (an internal representation of the desired state of the node)
2. puppet then works through the catalog, applying each resource in turn
   1. first, if the resource on the server? if not, create it
   2. then, for each resource, it checks the value of each attribute in the catalog agains what actually exists on the server

### packages

if you specify that a given package should be installed, puppet will use the apprpriate package manager commands to install it on whatever platform it's running on.

- RESOURCE_TYPE: package
- ATTRIBUTE: usually only _ensure_ and it's value _installed

```pp
package { 'ntp':
    ensure => installed,
}
```

```pp
exec { "apt-update":
    command => "/usr/bin/apt-get update"
}

package { "vim":
	ensure => installed,
}
```

see what version of a package thinks you have installed, we can use the **puppet resource** tool: `puppet resource RESOURCE_TYPE`

- puppet resource package
- puppet resource file /tmp

puppet resource has an interactive config feature. `puppet resource -e package openssl` - puppet generates a manifest for the current state of the resource and open it in an editor. if you make changes and save it, puppet will automatically apply that manifest to make changes to the system

### services c2

service: a long running process that either does some continuous kind of work, or waits for requests and then acts on them

```pp
service { "sshd":
    ensure => running,
    enable => true,
}
```

in services

- ensure: running or stopped
- enable: start on system boots

`puppet describe service`; see a list of all the available resource types `puppet describe --list`

### package-file-service pattern

the **package** resource installs the software, the **file** resource deploys one or more configuration files required for the software, and the **service** resource runs the software itself

```pp
package { 'mysql-server':
    ensure => installed,
    notify => Service['mysql'],
}

file { '/etc/mysql/mysql.cnf':
    source => '/examples/files/mysql.cnf',
    notify => Service['mysql'],
}

service { 'mysql':
    ensure => running,
    enable => true,
}
```

notify: what this does depends on the resource; when it's a service, the default action is to restart the service to _notify_ that there has been a change. the name of the resource to notify is specified as the resource type, capitalized, followed by the resource title, quoted and between square brackets: `Service['mysql']`

puppet applies resources in the same order in which they are declared in the manifest, _unless you explicitly specify a different order using the **require** attribute_.

all resources support the `require` attribute - its value is the name of another resource declared somewhere in the manifest, specified in the same way as when using _notify_.

```pp
package { 'mysql-server':
    ensure => installed,
}

file { '/etc/mysql/mysql.cnf':
    source  => '/examples/files/mysql.cnf',
    notify  => Service['mysql'],
    require => Package['mysql-server'],
}

service { 'mysql':
    ensure  => running,
    enable  => true,
    require => [Package['mysql-server'], File['/etc/mysql/mysql.cnf']],
}
```

## chapter 3

`puppet agent -t` apply changes on the volume

in the masterless puppet architecture, we can use Git to distribute manifests to client nodes, which then runs (`puppet apply *.pp`//`puppet agent -t`) to update their configuration. no master server, no SPOF.

we need a Git server which each node can connect to and clone the repo.

in a stand-alone/masterless arch, each node needs to automatically fetch any changes from the Git repo at regular intervals, and apply then with Puppet. we can do that with a shell scrip and include it on the cron job

```sh
#!/bin/bash
cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production && git pull
/opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet apply manifests/
```

for this to work we need to have a repository initialized on `/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production` which means git is to be installed as well.

## chapter 4

### Files

path attribute: `path` is one of the attributes you can specify for a `file`, but if you don't specify it, Puppet will use the title of the resource as the value of `path`

**source** attribute puts a copy of the file in the puppet repo, and have puppet simply copy it to the desired place in the fs

```pp
file { "/etc/motd":                         # move here
    source => "/examples/files/motd.txt"    # this file - FULL PATH or URL
}
```

to copy the file tree, subdirectories, we use **recurse**

```pp
file { '/destination/full/path':
    source  => '/dir/full/path',
    recurse => true,
}
```

#### ownership & permissions

```pp
file { '/etc/owned_by_ubuntu':
    ensure  => present,
    owner   => 'dxcuser',
    group   => 'dxcusergroup',
    mode    => '0644',
}
```

#### symbolic links

```pp
file { "/etc/this_is_a_link":
    ensure  => link,
    target  => "/etc/motd",
}
```

### Packages

uninstall a package. absent removes the package but leaves in place any files managed by the package. to purge all the files associated with the package, use `purged` instead of `absent`

```pp
package { "apparmor":
    ensure => absent,
}
```

specific versions of a package

```pp
package { "openssl":
    ensure => "1.0.2g-lubuntu4.8", # this specific versions
    # ensure => latest, # latest availble version is installed every time the manifest is applied automatically
}
```

library packages for the ruby programming language are known as **gems**. puppet can install ruby gems using `provider => gem`:

```pp
package { "ruby":
    ensure => installed,
}

packge { "puppet-lint":
    ensure      => installed,
    provider    => gem,
}
```

puppet has it's own version of ruby - to apply a gem to puppet's capabilities we have to use `puppet_gem` rather than just `gem`

ensure_packages: to avoid potential package conflicts between different parts of the puppet code

### services c4

hasstatus attribute: if you findthat puppet keeps attempting to start the service on every puppet run, even though the service is running, it may be that puppet's default service status detection (`systemctl is-active <SERVICE>`) isn't working

```pp
service {
    ensure      => running,
    enable      => true,
    hasstatus   => false,
}
```

**false** means that puppet knows not to try to check the service status using the default system service management command, and instead, will look in the process table for a running process which matches the name of the service. if it finds one, it will infer that the service is runningand take no further action

if hassttus isn't enough (the process doesn't appear on the process table/has a different name) you can tell puppet what to look for using the `pattern` attribute. hasstatus = false and **pattern** specified, puppet will search for the value of `pattern` in the process table to determine whether or not the service is running

```pp
service { "ntp":
    ensure      =>  running,
    enable      =>  true,
    hasstatus   =>  false,
    pattern     =>  "ntpd",
}
```

`hasrestart => true` means that puppet will try to send a _restart_ command to it. if the default restart command doesn't work, we can specify the restart command you like for the service using the restart attribute `restart => '/bin/echo Restarting >> /tmp/debug.log && systemctl restart ntp',`

### users

user is a named entity that can own files and run commands with certain permissions.

```pp
group { "devs":
    ensure  => present,
    gid     => 3000,
}

user { "hsing-hui":
    ensure  => present,
    uid     => "3001",
    home    => "/home/hsing-hui",
    shell   => "/bin/bash",
    groups  => ["devs"],
}
```

add authorized keys

```pp
ssh_uthorized_key { "joseemailazo@lemail.com":
    user    => "ubuntu",
    type    => "ssh-rsa",
    key     => "AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAIEA3ATqENg+GWACa2BzeqTdGnJhNoBer8x6pfWkzNzeM8Zx7/2Tf2pl7kHdbsiTXEUawqzXZQtZzt/j3Oya+PZjcRpWNRzprSmd2UxEEPTqDw9LqY5S2B8og/ NyzWaIYPsKoatcgC7VgYHplcTbzEhGu8BsoEVBGYu3IRy5RkAcZik=",
}
```

```pp
user { "godot":
    ensure  => absent,
}
```

### cron

```pp
cron { "run-puppet":
    command     => "/usr/local/bin/run-puppet",
    # user        => "ubuntu", # who should run the command
    # environment => ["MAILTO=admin@example.com", "PATH=/bin"], # env varibles for the cron job
    hour        => "*",
    # hour      => "0",
    minute      => "*/15",
    # minute    => "0",
    # weekdy    => ["Saturday", "Sunday"],
}
```

rather than running a cron job in bulk on the whole environment, we can use `fqdn_rand()`. it provides  random number up to a specified maximum value, which will be different on each node.

```pp
cron { "run daily backup":
    command => "/usr/local/bin/backup",
    minute  => "0",
    hour    => fqdn_rand(24, "run daily backup"),
}

cron { "run daily backup sync":
    command => "/usr/local/bin/backup_sync",
    minute  => "0",
    hour    => fqdn_rand(24, "run daily backup sync"),
}
```

because we gave a different string as the second argument to `fqdn_rand` for each cron job, it will return a different random value for each `hour` attribute.

removing the resource declaration from your puppet manifest does not remove the corresponding config from the node - in order to do that you need to specify `ensure => absent` on the resource.

### exec

an `exec` allows you to run any arbitrary command on the node

```pp
exec { "warever-software":
    cwd     => "/tmp/warever-software",  # where the command will be executed
    command => "/tmp/warever-software/configure && /usr/bin/make/install",  # use the full path for the commands
    creates => "/usr/local/bin/warever-software",   # a file which should exist after the command has been run - without creates attribute, an exec resource will run every time puppet runs
    user    => "ubuntu",
}
```

if _user_ is not specified, the command is run as root user.

#### onlyif and unless

- `onlyif`: it specifies a command for puppet to run, and the exit status from this command determines whether or not the exec will be applied (0 == success, non-zero == failure)

```pp
exec { "process-incoming-warever":
    command => "/usr/local/bin/warever-software --import /tmp/incoming/*",
    onlyif  => "/bin/ls /tmp/incoming/*",
}
```

onlyif attribute specifies the check command which puppet should run first, to determine whether or not the exec resource needs to be applied

- `unless`: if you specify a command to the unless attribute, the exec will always be run unless the command returns a zero exit status

#### refreshonly

- `refreshonly`: an exec resource needs to run only when some other puppet resource is changed. value _true_ (exec will never be applied unless another resource triggers it with **notify**) or _false_.

```pp
file { "/etc/aliases":
    content => "root: john@warever.com",
    notify  => Exec["newaliases"],
}

exec { "newaliases":
    command     => "/usr/bin/newaliases",
    refreshnoly => true,
}
```

when this manifest is applied for the first time, the /etc/aliases resource causes a change to the file's contents, so puppet sends a notify message to the exec resource. the use of this attribute is not that common.

#### logouput

this attribute determines whether puppet will log the ouput of the exec command along with the usual informative puppet output. three values: true, false, on_failure (this is the default)

#### timeout

by default puppet allows an exec command to run for 300 seconds (5 min), at which point puppet will terminate it; to allow longer period of time to complete, we can use timeout. the value is the maximum execution time for the command in seconds. timeout to 0 disables automatic timeout and allows the command to run forever (last resort).

## chapter 5

a variable in puppet is simply a wy of giving a name to a particular value:

```pp
$php_package = "php7.0-cli"

package { $php_package:
    ensure  => installed
}
```

the dollar sign tells puppet that what follows is a variable name (var names _must_ begin with a a lowercase letter or an underscore)

vars can contain diff types of data: strins, numbers or boolean values

```pp
$my_name = "joe"
$age = 31
$scheduled = true
```

### variables in strings

interpolate: puppet inserts the current value of the variable into the contents of the string, replacing the name of the variable

```pp
$my_name = joe
notice("hello, ${my_name}!")
```

### arrays

array is an ordered sequence of values, each of which can be of any type

```pp
$heights = [193, 120, 160, 174]

$first_heigh = $heights[0]
```

### array of resources

```pp
$dependencies = [
    'php7.0-cgi',
    'php7.0-cli',
    'php7.0-common',
    'php7.0-gd',
    'php7.0-json',
    'php7.0-mcrypt',
    'php7.0-mysql',
    'php7.0-soap',
]

package { $dependencies:
    ensure  => installed,
}
```

giving an array of strings as the title of a resource results in puppet creating multiple resources, all identical except for the title

### hashes

a hash, aka a dictionary, is like an array, but instead of just being a sequence of values, each value has a name:

```pp
$heights = {
    'john'  => 193,
    'rabiah' => 120,
    'abigail' => 181,
    'melina' => 164,
    'sumiko' => 172,
}

notice("joh's height is ${heights['john']}cm.")
```

we can do the same with attributes

```pp
$attributes = {
    'owner' => 'ubuntu',
    'group' => 'ubuntu',
    'mode'  => '0644',
}
file { '/tmp/test':
    ensure  => present,
    *       => $attributes,
}
```

*, aka attribute splat operator, tells puppet to treat the specified hash as a list of attribute-value pairs to apply to the resource.

### expressions

expressions also have a value - simplest expressions are just literal values: 42, true, "whats uppp". we can combine numeric values with arithmetic operators to create arithmetic expressions

```pp
$value = (17 * 8) + (12 / 4) -1
notice($value)
```

boolean expressions (all of these return _true_):

```pp
notice(9 < 10)
notice(11 > 10)
notice(10 >= 10)
notice(10 <= 10)
notice('foo' == 'foo')
notice('foo' in 'foobar')
notice('foo' in ['foo', 'bar'])
notice('foo' in { 'foo' => 'bar' })
notice('foo' =~ /oo/)
notice('foo' =~ String)
notice(1 != 2)
```

regex: `=~` tries to match a given value against a regular expression

```pp
$candidate = "foo"
notice($candidate =~ /foo/) # literal
notice($candidate =~ /f.o/) # f, any character, o
```

### conditional expressions

#### if statements

```pp
$install_perl = true
if $install_perl {      # if var install_perl is true, apply ensure => installed
    package { 'perl':
        ensure  => installed,
    }
} else {    # if var install_perl is false, apply ensure => absent
    package { 'perl':
        ensure => absent,
    }
}
```

#### case statements

```pp
$webserver = 'nginx'
case $webserver {
    'nginx': {
        notice("Looks like you're using Nginx! Good choice!")
    }
    'apache': {
        notice("Ah, you're an Apache fan, eh?")
    }
    'IIS': {
        notice('Well, somebody has to.')
    }
    default: {
        notice("I'm not sure which webserver you're using!")
    }
}
```

### finding out facts

**Facter** - mechanism for getting system information; each piece of information provided by facter is known as a **fact**.

facts hash: puppet variable called to access facter facts: `notice($facts['kernel'])` || older versions `notice($::kernel)`.

`facter os`: shows the hash of available os-related facts; `puppet facts` what facts will be available to puppet manifests; facter os/uptime (system_uptime)/timezone/ruby/path

to access a particular value in a hash, you specify the key name in square brackets. to access a value inside a hash, you add anotehr key name in square brakes after the first - `notice($facts['os']['distro']['codename'])`

```pp
if $facts['os']['selinux']['enabled'] {
    notice('SELinux is enabled')
} else {
    notice('SELinux is disabled')
}
```
