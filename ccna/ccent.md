### OSI Model

Not that much implemented (?)

| Layer | Name | Function | Protocol | Devices |
| ----- | ---- | -------- | -------- | ------- |
| L7 | application | 
| L6 | presentation | 
| L5 | session | 
| L4 | transport | 
| L3 | network | 
| L2 | data link | forwarding to the next device
| L1 | physical | media pathways | - | cabling, connectors, lights, hubs |

- L7 - L5: prepares the data for destionation to understand - happens inside the computer - application block
- L4 - L1: prepares the data for network delivery to the destination - ensures that we don't put data on the network that does not know where it's going, which is it's destination

Please, Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away

1. L1: data has to have a pathway to reach it's destination
2. L2: data gets changed so that it can be transferred; making sure that data is transferred to the device that will transmit it; forwarding to the next device. layer 2 addressing.
